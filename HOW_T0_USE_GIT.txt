Follow these instructions AFTER you have followed the Bitbucket 101 tutorials with git clone, git init, etc.

When you first start coding for the day, do the following to make sure you code on your computer is up to date:
git pull

When you want to add a new feature, fix a bug, etc then make a new branch:
git branch branchName
Once you have made your branch, you need to switch to it:
git checkout branchName
When you are done with your branch and you want to put it back into the final code:
git checkout master
git merge branchName

When you make a new file and you would like to add it to the project:
git add fileName

When you have completed a feature, you need to do a "commit" To do this:
git commit -m "Type a message here on what feature or bug you completed"

When you are done for the day and want to put your code onto the server for all of us to enjoy:
git push origin branch

Anytime that you want to check to make sure you do not have any files to commit or add:
git status
it will display to you files that you need to commit or add to the project.
